# NewsWire

NewsWire is a React-based web application that displays the latest news articles. It fetches data from the NewsAPI to provide up-to-date news content. The app is designed to be easy to use and navigate, allowing users to stay informed about current events.

Please note that the live preview of this web app is not available in this repository. The NewsAPI service used to fetch news data requires a deployment server, which is not provided in the free package. However, you can still download the source code and preview the app on your local machine by following these steps:

## Installation

To download and preview the source code of the web app, please follow these steps:

1. Visit the GitHub repository: [link-to-your-repository](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo).
2. Click on the "Code" button.
3. Select "Download ZIP" to download the repository as a ZIP file.
4. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your local machine.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
6. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
`npm install`
7. Start the development server with the following command:
`npm start`

8. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

Please note that without the necessary NewsAPI key and a deployment server, you won't be able to fetch live news data. However, you can still explore the app's features, UI components, and code structure locally.
